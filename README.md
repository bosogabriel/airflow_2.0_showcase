# airflow_2.0_showcase
The idea of this project is to test airflow 2.0 capabilities as well as use the tool to extract data from different sources

# Local Env
I've created a conda virtual enviroment with airflow 2.0.2 and its dependancies in order to have autocompletion while developin, also airflow's docker-compose.yaml create the local airflow app and volume mounts dags, plugins and logs folders to work with locally.
